# fnf-cinema

Simple application for managing small cinema :)

## How to run it

Integration with Imdb API requires `IMDB_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
This can be done by doing:

```
export IMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
```

Then, to start application on local machine please run:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You will see API documentation [here](http://localhost:8080/api-doc).

Some endpoints, meant to be used by _cinema owners_, require additional authentication. This is
`X-Staff-User-Id` request header being populated with valid `uuidv4`. Swagger UI provides nice API for that and marks
endpoints with: ðŸ”“.

Database is prepopulated with movie catalog defined in requirements. New movies can also be added. One may say
this is not necessary as there's no plan for Fast and Furious series to continue - but we never know...

## Decisions

### Technology stack

I decided to limit new technologies to Kotlin. And we've:

- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL (via testcontainers)
- Spring data JDBC (this is actually also something new to me - but I've heard a lot of good things and wanted to give it a try)
- Flyway
- JUnit 5

### Implementation

#### Functionality

- Fast and Furious movies are populated by app automatically - as we're clearly starting with them
- _add new movie_ functionality was introduced and was helpful in writing tests
- Movies' listing endpoint does not have any filtering as we're initially dealing with 9 items
- Movies' can be rated
- Movie details endpoint combines internal data with details fetched from Imdb; if data from Imdb can not be fetched for any reason - just internal data is returned
- Shows can be added/modified/deleted only by _staff_ (I assume on production real auth would happen somewhere above this service but identity of calling user should be somehow passed - `X-Staff-User-Id`)
- Shows listing is returning _nearest_ shows looking from _now()_; query can be done for specific movie or without

#### Imdb API

Imdb API responses are cached via Spring cache (backed by Caffeine) for 15 minutes since they're fetched.
This should allow for some balance between:

- time every request takes to be processed
- data changes made on Imdb side (like voting functionality)
- numbers of requests limit for single API key (for single instance and 9 movies it's < 1000 requests)

End-to-end test calling real API can be included in build when:

1. `IMDB_API_KEY` env variable is provided
2. `tests.endtoend` gradle project property is set to `true`

Example:

```
export IMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-goes-here
./gradlew -Ptests.endtoend=true test
```

Thing to tackle:

- circuit breaker

#### Persistence

Spring Data JDBC takes care of persistence. I played a bit with optimistic locking realised via version field
persisted on entity level - which became useful for the way I've chosen to tackle movies' rating. (Or maybe I've
chosen this way to play a bit with optimistic locking..?)

There's dedicated test proving it works: `MovieRatingMultiThreadedTest`. It is disabled by default and can be included
by:

```
./gradlew -Ptests.multithreaded=true test
```

#### Testing

There are various levels of testing:

- unit testing: scenarios focusing on some value objects and entities - like for example avg rating calculation logic
- integration testing: testing main application logic on _facades_ (`Movies` and `Shows`) level; it uses real database delivered by testcontainers
- Imdb API client testing: real HTTP request is fired against `mockserver`
- api tests: rest layer logic; main _facades_ are mocks and tests are verifying that API responds with expected HTTP responses
- end-to-end test: described above single scenario test interacting with Imdb API
